The implemented AI based Assistant for Trip Planner was a small attempt towards Agentic world of AI. 
# What was implemented:
> Langgraph based Agentic flow (parallel, merge, utility functions and graph flow was done).
> Web search Tools used were - DuckDuckGo, Tavily
> LLM Models used were - Groq, Anthropic
> weather search, currency exchange rate purpose third party REST API used with the help of requests.
> Modulerized code implemented.
> Some utility functions were also implemented. In future these can be moved to another file.
> All the requirements were addressed at high level.
>
# TODO Activities:
1. proper deployment of tool(s) and well defined control for tools invocation (tool sake implemented but do not want to give the control to LLM, hence removed)
2. conditional edges were implemnted but it was not necessary hence removed (code moved to commented section)
3. Some optimization in cost summarization and consolidated report needed.
4. Implmented chatGPT, google Gemini feedback on the code. Need to further review for better code.
5. Need to make it more modularized for llm passing, do init once and use many times kind of approach. At present many places creating, using and destroying. In long run this may lead to lot of latency and resource challenges.
